        <h2>Simple, Reliable Streaming</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to The Webcast Project, a custom-built streaming solution designed to replace 
            the Teradek system traditionally used by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
            With a focus on simplicity, affordability, and flexibility, Webcast enables anyone to set up a reliable
            livestream using a Raspberry Pi and our custom software - no complicated configuration required.
        </p>
        <h2>Why I Built Webcast</h2>
        <p>
            I was looking for a straightforward, easy-to-use system that could be used to stream Sunday services
            during COVID. After spending some time and not finding anything that fit my needs, I decided to build it
            myself!
        </p>
